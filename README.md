# Express.js JSON Body Parsing Issue

This repository demonstrates a common issue in Express.js applications where the request body is not parsed correctly when using `express.json()` middleware.

## Bug
The provided Express.js code snippet uses `express.json()` to parse JSON requests, but it might fail to correctly parse the JSON body under specific circumstances. This is likely due to an issue in the way the middleware is configured or a mismatch between the expected data format and the actual data being sent. 

## Solution
The solution involves double-checking the middleware configuration and ensuring the JSON data sent in the request is properly formatted.
